# recursedlevels

A repo for the 3 custom levels I made for Recursed. These levels explore mechanics that aren't used in the base game, and even have their own custom tile packs!

To add the levels to your game, find the "custom" folder in the game install location and copy the two folders (missions & tiles) into it.

Here are all the levels and their estimated difficulty levels:

- Return (Crystal): Medium
- Return (Diamond): Hard
- Return (Ruby): Easy-Medium
- Escape (Crystal): Medium-Hard
- Escape (Diamond): Very Hard
- Retrieval (Crystal): Hard
- Retrieval (Diamond): Very Hard
- Retrieval (Ruby): Medium

Good luck and have fun with solving the levels!
